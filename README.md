This is a United States geography matching quiz built with React.js. 

Match the flag at the top with the corresponding state in the unlabeled map. The score bar shows a running tally of the correct and incorrect selections, as well as the incorrect state the user selected. If the user selects the right state, they are given a new random flag to match. 

The map is an SVG file from Wikipedia.
